a payment application intended for deployment by the united states treasury that eliminates monetary inflation, systemic default risk, and the uncompetitive access to capital  

systemaccounting optimizes the flow of capital by expediting the discovery of economic opportunity through physics and data science. dashboarding real-time business performance within an equally-accessible space spanned by a metric not only maximizes capital's throughput between investors and entrepreneurs, it also transparently benchmarks lending rates between borrowers and lenders. in addition to eliminating interest rate manipulation by central commitees, systemaccounting solves monetary inflation and systemic default risk through its practice of cross-user, double-entry accounting. by recording transactions as conserved quantites, user equity remains separate and protected from the liability produced by government-chartered lending firms

### faqs
**q.** is this a "cryptocurrency"?  
**a.** no, and please use the word *encryption*  

**q.** is this a "blockchain"?  
**a.** no, and please use the word *replication*  

**q.** i dont find any words in here used by the media. what is this?  
**a.** encryption solves access risk. replication solves single point of failure and inconsistency risk. neither of these solutions are relevant to modeling a currency as an electric current. this payment application solves current economic issues by replacing "monetary" policy with a natural physical law. encryption and replication are secondary  

**q.** what is the equation?  
**a.** *u* = transactions per second, *w<sub>i</sub>* = value conserved per transaction, *Mx!* = value visible in a combinatorial game  

**q.** do you have any demos?  
**a.** watch the *economic policy as code* video series  

**q.** how to explain this project to non engineers?  
**a.** share the *economic policy as code* video series  

**q.** why is the code public if the license is private?  
**a.** publicly used code is a public structure

### use cases
public demonstration of the following use cases through a systemaccounting function:
* expressing a [conservation law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_law) through a [data structure](https://github.com/systemaccounting/mxfactorial/blob/develop/mxfactorial.ipynb) disambiguates *delivered* value from *expected* value, and replaces [committees](https://www.federalreserve.gov/financial-stability.htm) with an automated [financial stability criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIBO_stability)
* producing a [scientific measure](http://www.systemaccounting.org/how_does_systemaccounting_produce_a_scientific_measure_of_the_cost_of_capital) of the equilibrium price of capital signals the demand for capital with an empirical rate of return instead of a [government defined word](https://www.systemaccounting.org/what_is_a_bank), and removes the ability of a central authority to [manipulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate) the price of credit
* `SELECT SUM(price) FROM transactions WHERE time = NOW();` maximizes & protects for individuals a scientific standard the publicly-measured quarterly or annual '[GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product)' violates
* where an industry is [chartered](http://www.occ.gov/topics/licensing/index-licensing.html), [protected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailout), and [primarily depended upon](http://www.opensecrets.org/industries./) by a government requiring [election assistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collusion), conserving value & liability (information) separates the balance sheets of governments from individuals, and eliminates [socializing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality#Negative) the [default risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liability_(financial_accounting)) of any individual or firm
* establishing the conditions studied by [combinatorial game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_game_theory) through physics & data science ends public dependency on such resources as [credit ratings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_credit_rating), [quarterly filings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_10-Q), the Consumer Price Index ([CPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index)), and the federal reserve economic data ([FRED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Economic_Data)) platform
* *accounts as projective coordinates*: structuring transactions between debiting and crediting users [across time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates) as a [binary logarithmic event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_logarithm#Information_theory) creates a [2^n dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra#Basis_and_dimension) in a data model
* *data as multivectors*: financial value is a [bivector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivector)-valued function of buyers and sellers adding ownership-coordinates to a [3d space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_geometric_algebra)  parameterized by "time". the [dual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodge_star_operator) positive and negative string values expressed by the anticommutativity of the `"creditor" ∧ "debitor" = - ("debitor" ∧ "creditor")` exterior product defines the [continuity point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(topology)) a [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-scale_calculus)-dependent projection depends on to propagate [zero-sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game) changes to account balances

this project intends to exploit the software engineering community's familiarity with data science to rapidly develop their capacity to describe an economy using mathemtical physics. software engineers may be expediently converted to phd-level experts because they come equipped with the technology to test, adopt, and communicate the subject to others. adding to the project's **[list of features](https://github.com/systemaccounting/mxfactorial/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Apublic+sort%3Acreated-asc)** is designed to foster enough interaction between engineers and the data model that a movement to eliminate nothing but [public ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency) becomes generally accepted as possible *only* when it's precipitated by activism pursued—not in the streets where slogans, bottles, and rocks are blindly hurled at others who are equally frustrated with their economy, but on knowledge's frontier where science and technology are used as tools to empower mankinds revolution in the cloud

### roadmap
* set up managed application & persistence layer
* produce requirements & code for:
  * data model
  * endpoints
  * mobile web client for transactions (write)
  * mobile-enabled web client for visualizing economic activity (read) through the [data layer](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/datalayer) feature of the google maps javascript api  

**note**: both transaction and visualization clients will be strictly served by publicly-accessible endpoints to demonstrate for the u.s. treasury that with enough security, anyone may build an app that submits transaction data to the public ledger, thereby eliminating "banks" from the [value transmission](http://www.systemaccounting.org/what_is_money) equation
